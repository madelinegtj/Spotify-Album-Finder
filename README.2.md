# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

React is a JavaScript library for building UIs (user interfaces). With reusable components, React makes it easier for us to create web applications! Components can be buttons, widgets, cards, and more, as you create them. If you're familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, learning React will allow us to combine everything with JSX, the JavaScript syntax extension for React.
